## HEFCE Project: “Improving Student Engagement and Retention through “human-in-the-loop” Learning Analytics”

The aim of this HEFCE-funded project is to develop novel Learning Analytics techniques, incorporating practitioner knowledge and student insights, to improve outcomes for Undergraduate students.
 
The significant benefits of learning analytics for improving teaching and supporting learners are well understood (HE Commission, “From Bricks to Clicks”, 2016). The importance of course-specific data, acknowledgement of student learning styles, and appreciation of discipline-specific pedagogical approaches, is critical in developing effective Learning Analytics.
 
Failure to incorporate practitioner knowledge, and student experience, means the full potential of Learning Analytics is rarely realised, limiting the quality of actionable insights. This presents significant barriers to student attainment, compromising our ability to enact timely interventions for at-risk students.
 
We propose a “human-in-the-loop” approach, engaging students and course leaders as active partners in Learning Analytics. This enables richer interaction with data, encouraging dialogue around student progress.
 
A novel software tool will provide advanced interactive data exploration capabilities, and contribute insights to inform the analytics process. Our approach tailors Learning Analytics to the specific disciplinary, educational and instructional context, strengthening the quality of interventions, and their impact on student outcomes.
 
The project engages each of our three Faculties, across two academic years, in a pilot of the technology.

### Glance

As part of the project, we have developed a prototype application called **Glance**. Glance creates “survey dashboards” containing sets of visualisations about student engagement and performance, asking instructors to compare and rank students based on their predicted performance in a given module, 

The application provides a framework for:  

* Evaluating the impact of different instructor facing dashboards, by measuring the accuracy of instructors’ mental models of student performance when presented with each.

* Capturing instructor predictions about student performance through an intuitive and easy-to-use interface. These may then be measured for accuracy against students’ true performance and used to improve simple machine learning models. 
 
The applications itself has been used for a number of small scale studies here at Newcastle, but was never intended to be Newcastle specific. To that end, it is [open sourced](https://github.com/LearningAnalyticsUK/soar-glance) under a permissive license, its setup and use thoroughly documented.
