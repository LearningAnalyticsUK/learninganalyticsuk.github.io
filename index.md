The aim of this HEFCE-funded project is to develop novel Learning Analytics techniques, incorporating practitioner knowledge and student insights, to improve outcomes for Undergraduate students.
 
The significant benefits of learning analytics for improving teaching and supporting learners are well understood (HE Commission, “From Bricks to Clicks”, 2016). The importance of course-specific data, acknowledgement of student learning styles, and appreciation of discipline-specific pedagogical approaches, is critical in developing effective Learning Analytics.
 
Failure to incorporate practitioner knowledge, and student experience, means the full potential of Learning Analytics is rarely realised, limiting the quality of actionable insights. This presents significant barriers to student attainment, compromising our ability to enact timely interventions for at-risk students.
 
We propose a “human-in-the-loop” approach, engaging students and course leaders as active partners in Learning Analytics. This enables richer interaction with data, encouraging dialogue around student progress.
 
A novel software tool will provide advanced interactive data exploration capabilities, and contribute insights to inform the analytics process. Our approach tailors Learning Analytics to the specific disciplinary, educational and instructional context, strengthening the quality of interventions, and their impact on student outcomes.
 
The project engages each of our three Faculties, across two academic years, in a pilot of the technology.
